# Bugs

-   Fix indentation when moving lines left and right
-   Moving words up and down gradually works cursor left/right
-   Deleting the only block in a scope deletes the scope too
-   Extend mode is pretty broken (especially going up or left)
-   Selecting with the mouse is broken in one direction
-   Exiting extend mode goes back to word in all cases
-   Deleting blocks doesn't clean up

# TODO

-   Add tests
-   Add jump interface for subjects
-   Add slash to edit at mid-point of selection
