# Bugs

-   Fix indentation when moving lines left and right
-   Moving words up and down gradually works cursor left/right
-   Extend mode is pretty broken (especially going up or left)
-   Exiting extend mode goes back to word in all cases
-   Currently no way to drop to single cursor in any mode (due to escape key binding)

# Features to add

-   Add tests
-   Add subject display name
